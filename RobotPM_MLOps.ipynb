    "# 🚀 Robot Predictive Maintenance: MLOps Architecture Enhancements\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the evolution of the Linear Regression project into a professional MLOps-ready framework. It integrates real-time streaming simulation with cloud-based database connectivity and statistical anomaly detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏗️ 1. Project Structure Overview\n",
    "To ensure reproducibility and maintainability, the project follows standard MLOps architectural patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Directory/File | Description |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **`configs/`** | **Config-Driven Development**: Manages DB URLs and thresholds via `experiment_config.yaml`. |\n",
    "| **`data/raw/`** | **Immutable Data**: Stores the original `RMBR4-2_export_test.csv` for baseline training. |\n",
    "| **`data/processed/`** | **Processed Artifacts**: Contains `synthetic_test_data.csv` and the generated `alert_events.csv`. |\n",
    "| **`experiments/`** | **Tracking**: Records model performance metrics (RMSE, R² scores) in `results.csv`. |\n",
    "| **`models/`** | **Persistence**: Stores trained weights as `.pkl` files for deployment without retraining. |\n",
    "| **`src/`** | **Modular Code**: Houses `stream_monitor.py` (DBPoller, AlertEngine, LivePlotter). |\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔍 2. Threshold Discovery & Maintenance Logic\n",
    "Unlike static thresholds, these values were derived through **Residual Analysis** of Axis #1 telemetry:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **MinC (Alert) [1.372A]**: Set at **$2\\sigma$** from the residual mean to identify early performance deviations.\n",
    "* **MaxC (Error) [2.058A]**: Set at **$3\\sigma$** from the residual mean to identify critical outliers and potential stress.\n",
    "* **Persistence Rule ($T$)**: Alerts require **90s ($T=3$)** and Errors require **60s ($T=2$)** of sustained deviation to filter transient noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛠️ 3. Functional Enhancements\n",
    "The pipeline has been upgraded to handle real-world industrial data complexities:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Hybrid Data Ingestion**: Supports **PostgreSQL (Neon)** connectivity via `load_from_db` for scalable cloud-based streaming.\n",
    "* **Synthetic Stream Simulation**: Uses **Inverse Z-score Standardization** to generate realistic testing data based on training metadata (`mean` and `std`).\n",
    "* **Advanced Preprocessing**: Integrated **Moving Average Smoothing** to filter high-frequency sensor noise that hinders model accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 4. Real-Time Performance & Alerting\n",
    "The implementation translates mathematical slopes from the Linear Regression model into proactive maintenance actions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Predictive Trend Analysis**: A real-time **Regression Trend Line** is calculated to predict when current levels will cross failure boundaries.\n",
    "* **Automated Event Logging**: The `AlertEngine` identifies sustained anomalies and logs them directly to `alert_events.csv`.\n",
    "* **Visual Dashboard**: Overlays Alert (Orange X) and Error (Red Cross) markers on the live telemetry stream for immediate operator visibility.\n",
